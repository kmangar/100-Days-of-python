"""I was reading this article by Tim Urban - Your Life in Weeks and realised just how little time we actually have.

https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html

Create a program using maths and f-Strings that tells us how many days, weeks, months we have left if we live until 90 years old.

It will take your current age as the input and output a message with our time left in this format:

You have x days, y weeks, and z months left.

Where x, y and z are replaced with the actual calculated numbers.

#  ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
age = int(input("What is your current age?"))
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

# Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡

days = 365 *(90 - age)
weeks = 52 * (90 - age)
months = 12 * (90 - age)

print(f"You have {days} days, {weeks} weeks, and {months} months left.")
